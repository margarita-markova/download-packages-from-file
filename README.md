# Python Scripts Utils

##### Simple scripts for work. 

* [download.py] - script for downloading packages by url from .log (or else extension) file to destination folder. You can choose extension of downloaded files (for instance, "deb" or "gpg").  Example source file:
    ```sh
    http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/wheezy/Release.gpg
    http://archive.debian.org/debian/pool/main/a/acl/libacl1_2.2.51-8_amd64.deb
    http://archive.debian.org/debian/pool/main/a/adduser/adduser_3.113+nmu3_all.deb
